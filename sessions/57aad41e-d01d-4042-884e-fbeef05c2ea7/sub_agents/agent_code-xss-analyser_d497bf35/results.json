The analysis identified 11 distinct XSS vulnerabilities across multiple categories:\n\n**Critical Findings:**\n- **Global autoescape disabled** in Swig template engine (server.js:137)\n- **Stored XSS in memos** through unescaped Markdown processing \n- **Reflected XSS in research** module with raw external content injection\n- **Environmental script injection** without validation\n\n**High-Severity Issues:**\n- Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in profile data display\n- Reflected XSS in error messages and login forms\n- User-controlled data in URL contexts without proper encoding\n\n**Systemic Problems:**\n- Consistent lack of output encoding across templates\n- Missing input validation and sanitization  \n- Unsafe handling of external content sources\n\nThe application demonstrates classic examples of all three main XSS types (Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based contexts), making it an excellent educational target for understanding Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities and their prevention.","session_id":"f2f59640-ec16-42da-99a5-4df150095a31","total_cost_usd":0.9858440999999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":216,"cache_creation_input_tokens":106370,"cache_read_input_tokens":1627712,"output_tokens":6533,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard"},"permission_denials":[]}
