The analysis identified **10 critical authentication and authorization vulnerabilities** across multiple severity levels:\n\n**Critical Findings:**\n- **Plaintext password storage** - Passwords stored without hashing\n- **Missing session regeneration** - Session fixation vulnerability  \n- **Missing admin authorization** - Benefits page accessible to all users\n- **Insecure Direct Object Reference** - Users can access other users' data\n\n**Key Security Gaps:**\n- No password hashing/encryption\n- Weak session management\n- Missing role-based access controls\n- Hardcoded secrets\n- Insecure HTTP communications\n\nThe application demonstrates multiple fundamental authentication security flaws that would allow attackers to compromise user accounts, escalate privileges, and access sensitive data. All vulnerabilities include detailed exploit examples and secure remediation guidance.","session_id":"e80ac6b5-e78c-4752-a9af-6e6b7ae3977a","total_cost_usd":0.5348631,"usage":{"input_tokens":144,"cache_creation_input_tokens":33302,"cache_read_input_tokens":1093662,"output_tokens":5430,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard"},"permission_denials":[]}
